# 🚀 Umbrella Corporation – AI Onboarding Assistant

An intelligent **AI-powered onboarding assistant** built using **Streamlit**, **RAG**, and **Groq LLMs**.
It guides new employees through policies, processes, and company information—just like a real HR assistant.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The Umbrella Onboarding Assistant is designed to:

* Answer employee questions about company policies
* Provide personalized responses based on employee data
* Generate summaries, policies, and onboarding guidance
* Use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate information
* Use **Groq API** for fast and cost-free inference
* Display a clean and interactive **Streamlit UI**

This project uses **synthetic employee data** generated via `Faker` to avoid using real HR information.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### 1️⃣ Synthetic Employee Data

Generated with `Faker` to simulate:

* Name, email, phone
* Position, department
* Skills
* Supervisor
* Hire date

### 2️⃣ RAG Pipeline

* Documents indexed into ChromaDB
* Query embeddings created using Groq
* Relevant context retrieved per user query

### 3️⃣ LLM Response

Groq generates the final answer using:

```
User Input + Retrieved Context + Employee Profile
```
